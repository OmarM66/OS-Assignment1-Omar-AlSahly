# CS3701 Operating Systems - Assignment 1: Multithreading
## Round-Robin CPU Scheduler Simulation

### 📋 Assignment Overview

This assignment evaluates your ability to implement and work with multithreading in Java while introducing professional software development practices including version control (GitHub), code documentation, and project presentation. You will work with a CPU scheduling simulation that uses a **Round-Robin algorithm** with a fixed **time quantum**.

**What You Will Do:**
- Fork a starter repository from GitHub and personalize it with your information
- Modify existing Java code to add three new features related to process scheduling
- Document your development process and reflect on what you learned
- Create a video demonstration explaining your work and understanding
- Submit your work through your public GitHub repository

**Important**: This assignment is worth **5%** of your final grade.

> ### 🛠️ Recommended: use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for this assignment
> Work on **everything in VS Code**: edit `SchedulerSimulation.java` and `MY_WORK.md`, run the program (needed for your video), and **link VS Code directly to your GitHub account** so you can **commit and push with a few clicks, no command line needed**.
>
> 👉 **Step-by-step setup, GitHub sign-in, and commit/push guide: see [Recommended Development Environment: VS Code + GitHub](#️-recommended-development-environment-vs-code--github) below.**
>
> ⚠️ Commits are graded: a single bulk commit costs **-0.5 mark**. VS Code makes it easy to commit after every feature and every work session.
>
> 🛑 **Before anything else:** read this whole README, then read and run the full `SchedulerSimulation.java` **before** answering any question.

## � Background: Understanding the Starter Code

The starter code simulates a CPU scheduling system where multiple processes compete for CPU time. Each process is represented by a `Process` class, and the `SchedulerSimulation` class manages their execution using a Round-Robin algorithm. Understanding these classes will help you complete the assignment.

### `Process` Class:
The `Process` class represents an individual process in the CPU scheduling simulation. Each process has **attributes** like a *name*, *burst time*, *remaining time*, and *time quantum*. **The process will either run for a specified time quantum or, if it is the last remaining process in the system, it will run until completion without [yielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(multithreading)) the CPU.**

#### Attributes:
- `String name`: The name of the process (e.g., "P1", "P2"). Used for identification in output messages.
- `int burstTime`: The total amount of time (in milliseconds) that the process requires to complete its execution. This is randomly assigned when the process is created.
- `int timeQuantum`: The time slice (in milliseconds) for which a process is allowed to run in each round-robin cycle. This value is fixed for all processes.
- `int remainingTime`: The remaining time (in milliseconds) for the process to complete. Initially, this is equal to the burstTime and decreases as the process runs.

#### Methods:
- `Process(String name, int burstTime, int timeQuantum)`: Constructor that initializes the `Process` object with a given `name`, `burstTime`, and `timeQuantum`. The `remainingTime` is initially set to be the same as the `burstTime`.
- `void run()`: 
  - Implements the `Runnable` interface's `run()` method. This method simulates the execution of the process for one time quantum or the remaining time, whichever is smaller.
  - After running for the allowed time, the remaining time is updated.
  - If the process still has time left to execute, it yields the CPU and is re-enqueued; otherwise, it completes its execution.
  - This method is always called when a `Thread` is started for the process.
- `void runToCompletion()`: 
  - This method is called when the process is the last one in the queue. Instead of running for a time quantum, the process runs until its remaining time reaches zero, meaning the process completes in a single run without being interrupted.
  - This method ensures that the last process does not get re-enqueued but instead finishes execution in one go.
- `String getName()`: A simple getter method to retrieve the name of the process.
- `int getBurstTime()`: A getter method to retrieve the total burst time (i.e., the full time the process needs for completion).
- `int getRemainingTime()`: A getter method to retrieve the remaining time that the process needs to complete its execution.
- `boolean isFinished()`: This method checks whether the process has completed its execution. It returns true if the remainingTime is less than or equal to zero, meaning no time is left for the process to run.

**Note:** The complete `Process` class implementation is available in the starter repository you will fork from GitHub.

### `SchedulerSimulation` Class:
The `SchedulerSimulation` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle and scheduling of processes. **It handles the creation of processes, placing them in a queue, and running them using a Round-Robin scheduling algorithm**. **When only one process remains, it runs to completion without respect to the time quantum**.

#### Attributes:
No instance variables in the class, but several data structures and constants are used within the methods.

#### Methods:
1. `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the entry point of the program. It simulates the scheduling of processes based on a Round-Robin algorithm with a fixed time quantum.

   **Key Tasks in main:**
   - **Time Quantum:** Defines the time quantum for scheduling, which is a random value between 2000 and 5000 milliseconds with a step of 1000 milliseconds. **The random seed is based on the student ID, so you are required to replace the seed with your student ID.**
   - **Process Creation:** Creates a specified number of processes (numProcesses). This number is randomly chosen between 10 and 20 according to the provided seed.
   - **Process Queueing:** Processes are added to a FIFO queue (`processQueue`), and each process is associated with its corresponding thread using a `Map<Thread, Process> (processMap)`. Each process has a unique name and burst time (randomly assigned between `timeQuantum/2` and `3×timeQuantum`).
   - **Scheduler Loop:** The scheduler retrieves each process from the queue and executes it using a thread. It checks whether a process is finished after its time quantum:
     - *If the process is not finished and there are other processes in the queue, it is re-enqueued.*
     - *If the process is the last one remaining, it is allowed to run until completion without being interrupted.*
   - **Completion:** The simulation ends when all processes have finished execution.

2. `public static void addProcessToQueue(Process process, Queue<Thread> processQueue, Map<Thread, Process> processMap)`: 
   - This helper method is responsible for adding a `Process` to the `processQueue` and associating it with a new `Thread` in the `processMap`. It also prints a message indicating that the process has entered the ready queue.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `Process process`: The process to be added to the queue.
   - `Queue<Thread> processQueue`: The queue that manages threads in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.
   - `Map<Thread, Process> processMap`: A mapping of threads to processes, so the scheduler can easily retrieve the process associated with each thread.
   
   - **Message:** Prints details about the process, including its burst time and remaining time, when it enters the ready queue.

**Note:** The complete `SchedulerSimulation` class implementation is available in the starter repository you will fork from GitHub. You will modify this file to add your student ID and implement the required features.

1. **Step 1: Create GitHub Account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
   - **CRITICAL:** Use your university email: `[yourid]@std.psau.edu.sa`
   - Example: `442105123@std.psau.edu.sa`
   - Choose a professional username (e.g., mohammed-ahmed-441)
   - Verify your email address before proceeding
   - **Note:** Using non-university email results in -0.25 marks penalty

2. **Step 2: Fork the Starter Repository:**
   - Make sure you're logged in to GitHub with your university email account
   - Go to the starter repository: `https://github.com/makopt/OS-Assignment1-Starter-481`
   - Click the **"Fork"** button at the top right corner
   - Wait for GitHub to create your copy (takes 5-10 seconds)
   - You will be redirected to YOUR forked repository
   - Your URL will be: `https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/OS-Assignment1-Starter-481`

3. **Step 3: Rename Your Repository:**
   - On YOUR forked repository page, click **"Settings"** tab (top right)
   - Under "Repository name", change from `OS-Assignment1-Starter-481` to: `OS-Assignment1-YourFirstName-YourLastName`
   - Example: `OS-Assignment1-Mohammed-Ahmed`
   - Click **"Rename"** button
   - **Verify repository is PUBLIC:** Scroll down to "Danger Zone" section, check visibility is "Public"

4. **Step 4: Set Your Student ID in Code:**
   - In your repository, click on `SchedulerSimulation.java`
   - Click the pencil/edit icon to edit the file
   - Find line 150: `int studentID = 123456789;`
   - Replace `123456789` with YOUR actual student ID
   - Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**
   - Commit message: `"Set my student ID: [YOUR-ID]"`
   - Click **"Commit changes"** again to confirm
   - **This is mandatory - your output must be unique!**

**Repository Structure:** The starter repository contains these files:
```
OS-Assignment1-Starter-481/
├── SchedulerSimulation.java  (Main code - YOU WILL MODIFY THIS)
├── MY_WORK.md                 (Student info, development log, reflection, answers, video link - fill in all sections)
├── README.md                  (Instructions - read carefully!)
└── .gitignore                 (Already configured for Java)
```

**Important:** Read the `README.md` file in the repository - it contains detailed instructions for every step!

**Enhanced Code Features:** The starter code includes several enhancements to help you visualize the scheduling process:
- **Color-Coded Output:** The code uses ANSI color codes to display different types of information (process states, queue status, completion messages) in different colors for better readability.
- **Visual Progress Bars:** Each process shows both quantum-level progress (during execution) and overall completion progress using visual progress bars.
- **Randomized Simulation:** The simulation uses your student ID as a seed to randomly generate:
  - Time quantum (2000-5000ms)
  - Number of processes (10-20 processes)
  - Burst time for each process
- **Ready Queue Visualization:** Before each process execution, the current state of the ready queue is displayed.
- **Formatted Headers:** Professional-looking headers and boxes to organize the output.

**These features are already implemented - your job is to add the three new features described in Part 2!**

## 🛠️ Recommended Development Environment: VS Code + GitHub

> 💡 **We strongly recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** for this assignment. You can edit `SchedulerSimulation.java` **and** `MY_WORK.md`, run the program, and **commit + push to GitHub, all in one window**, without typing Git commands. This makes it easy to commit often (which is required).

### Why VS Code?
- **Free** and works on Windows, macOS and Linux: [download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- **Built-in Git and GitHub support**: commit and push with a few clicks
- **Runs Java in the IDE** (needed for the video): the ▶ Run button shows the output in the IDE console
- **Previews Markdown**: edit `MY_WORK.md` and see it rendered side by side

### Step 1: Install the tools
1. Install a **JDK** (version 17 or later) and **Git** ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)). VS Code needs Git installed to commit.
2. Install VS Code, then install these **extensions** (Extensions icon in the left bar, or Ctrl+Shift+X):
   - **Extension Pack for Java** (Microsoft): run and debug Java
   - **GitHub Pull Requests** (GitHub): sign-in and GitHub integration
   - **GitLens**: shows the history of each line and your commit history
   - **Markdown All in One**: helps edit `MY_WORK.md`

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** If VS Code says *"Git not found"*, install Git and **restart VS Code**.

### Step 2: Link VS Code to your GitHub account
1. Click the **account icon** (bottom-left corner) → **Sign in with GitHub**.
2. Your browser opens: log in with **the GitHub account that uses your university email** and click **Authorize**.
3. Back in VS Code, your GitHub username now appears under the account icon.
4. Tell Git who you are (**one time only**). Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`) and run:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
   git config --global user.email "yourid@std.psau.edu.sa"
   ```

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Use your **university email** here. Commits made with another email can count as a non-university email (**-0.25 mark**).

### Step 3: Clone **your** fork into VS Code
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) → type **Git: Clone** → press Enter.
2. Choose **Clone from GitHub**, then select **your own renamed repository** (`OS-Assignment1-YourFirstName-YourLastName`), **not** the starter repository and **never another student's repository**.
3. Pick a folder on your computer, then click **Open** when VS Code asks.

> 💡 **TIP:** Save your work in a normal folder (e.g., Documents), **not** inside a synced or shared folder that other people can access.

### Step 4: Edit, then commit and push (repeat after every change!)
First **edit** `SchedulerSimulation.java` or `MY_WORK.md` and **save** (Ctrl+S). Then use **either** method below. Both work entirely with mouse and menus, **no Git command line needed**.

#### Method A: Source Control panel (recommended)
1. Open the **Source Control** panel (Ctrl+Shift+G, the branch icon in the left bar). Your changed files are listed under *Changes*.
2. Click a file to see **exactly what you changed** (green = added, red = removed). Check it before committing.
3. **Stage** the files: click the **+** next to each file (or next to *Changes* for all files).
4. Type a **clear commit message** in the box, e.g. `Feature 1: Added priority field to Process class`.
5. Click **✓ Commit**.
6. Click **Sync Changes** (or **Push**) to send the commit to GitHub.

#### Method B: Command Palette + status bar (no Source Control panel)
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) and run **Git: Stage All Changes** (or **Git: Stage** for one file).
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** again, run **Git: Commit**, type your commit message in the box that appears and press **Enter**.
3. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** once more and run **Git: Push**. Alternatively, click the **🔄 sync icon** in the blue **status bar** at the bottom-left (next to the branch name `main`) to sync.

#### Verify (both methods)
- Open your repository page on **github.com** and check that your new commit appears in the commit list.

> 🛑 **STOP:** A commit that is **not pushed** stays on your computer only. The instructor **cannot see it**. Always click **Sync Changes / Push** after committing.
>
> ⚠️ **WARNING (commits are graded):** Make **one commit per feature**, and commit **after each work session** and after each part of `MY_WORK.md`. Do **not** commit everything at once at the end (**-0.5 mark**).
>
> 💡 **TIP:** If VS Code asks *"Would you like Code to periodically run git fetch?"* or asks you to *Sync*, answer **Yes**. If it asks *"There are no staged changes, commit all?"*, **Yes** is fine as long as you checked the changes in step 3.

### Step 5: Run the program in VS Code (for your video)
1. Open `SchedulerSimulation.java`.
2. Click the **▶ Run** button at the top-right of the editor (or **Run | Debug** above `main`).
3. The output appears in the **Terminal / Debug Console** panel at the bottom of VS Code.

> 💡 **TIP:** You must run the program **from the IDE** in your video (not from an external terminal), so practice this now.

### Common problems
| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| *"Git not found"* | Install Git, restart VS Code |
| Push asks for a password | Use **Sign in with GitHub** (Step 2); passwords no longer work for GitHub |
| Push is rejected / *"behind remote"* | Click **Sync Changes** (pull, then push). This happens if you edited a file on github.com |
| Cloned the wrong repository | Delete the folder and clone **your own** fork again (Step 3) |
| Commit shows another name/email | Re-run the two `git config` commands in Step 2 |
| Colors look strange in the console (`←[36m`) | The output uses ANSI colors. Use the VS Code Terminal or Debug Console; it is only cosmetic |

- [VS Code GitHub Integration Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM)
- [Java Development in VS Code Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB0gZFpukJU)
- Official guide: search for *"VS Code Source Control"* in the VS Code documentation

**Note:** You may use another IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.), but the instructor's guidance and troubleshooting are based on VS Code, which has the smoothest GitHub integration.

### **Part 2: Code Implementation (1 mark)**

**Your Task:** Modify `SchedulerSimulation.java` to add three new features:

**Important Guidelines:**
- Make **one commit per feature** - do NOT commit everything at once!
- Test each feature before committing
- Add clear comments explaining your additions
- Keep the existing functionality working

**Commit Examples:**
- ✅ `"Feature 1: Added priority field to Process class"`
- ✅ `"Feature 2: Implemented context switch counter"`
- ✅ `"Feature 3: Added waiting time tracking and summary"`
- ❌ `"done"` or `"update"` or `"final version"` (too vague!)

#### 2.1: Feature 1 - Add Process Priority (0.25 mark)
- Add a `priority` field to the Process class (integer 1-10, where 10 is highest)
- Generate random priorities when creating processes
- Display priority when a process enters the ready queue
- Example output: `"P1 (Priority: 7) enters the ready queue..."`
- **Note:** Priority is for display/tracking only in this assignment - it does NOT change the Round-Robin order (that stays FIFO)
- Add clear comments explaining your additions

#### 2.2: Feature 2 - Count Context Switches (0.25 mark)
- Add a static counter variable for context switches
- Increment the counter each time a new process starts running
- Display total context switches at the end of simulation
- Example: `"Total context switches: 47"`
- A context switch occurs every time the CPU switches to a different process

#### 2.3: Feature 3 - Track Waiting Time (0.5 mark)
- Add fields to track when each process was created and total time spent waiting
- Calculate waiting time for each process
- Use `System.currentTimeMillis()` to track time
- Display a summary table at the end showing:
  - Process Name
  - Burst Time
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time (Waiting Time + Burst Time)
- Format the output in a clear, readable table

**Commit after EACH feature** (use **one** of the two options):

**Option A: VS Code (recommended, no command line)**
1. Save the file (Ctrl+S) and open the **Source Control** panel (Ctrl+Shift+G).
2. Click **+** next to `SchedulerSimulation.java` to stage it.
3. Type a message such as `Feature 1: Added priority field to Process class` and click **✓ Commit**.
4. Click **Sync Changes** (or **Push**) to send it to GitHub.

**Option B: Command line**
```bash
git add SchedulerSimulation.java
git commit -m "Added [feature name]: [brief description]"
git push origin main
```

> 💡 **TIP:** Full details, including the Command Palette method, are in *Recommended Development Environment* below.

### **Part 3: Documentation (1.5 marks)**

> 🛑 **Before you start:** read this whole `README.md` and the full `SchedulerSimulation.java` (run it too) **before** answering any question. Then open `MY_WORK.md`: it contains a **work roadmap**, **commit rules**, and ⚠️ warnings / 💡 tips at every step to guide you.
>
> ⚠️ **Commit often:** a single commit, or all commits in the last hour, costs **-0.5 mark**. Make at least 3 meaningful commits (one per feature), spread over different dates, and push them.

Complete the single `MY_WORK.md` file in your repository to document your work and demonstrate your understanding. **First fill in your full name and student ID** in its *Student Information* table. It then contains three sections:

## 📝 Questions to Answer (in MY_WORK.md)

These questions help you demonstrate technical understanding. Each answer should be thoughtful and specific.

### Question 1: Thread vs Process
- **Explain the difference** between a thread and a process
- **Why did we use threads** in this assignment instead of separate processes?
- **Mention at least TWO specific differences** (e.g., memory sharing, creation overhead, communication speed)
- **Reference relevant parts** of `SchedulerSimulation.java` where appropriate
- Minimum: 3-5 sentences

### Question 2: Ready Queue Behavior
- In Round-Robin scheduling, **what happens when a process doesn't finish** within its time quantum?
- **Explain using a specific example** from YOUR program output, including how many times that process was re-queued before finishing
- **Copy a relevant snippet** from your terminal output showing a process being re-queued
- **Explain why this re-queueing behavior** is important for fairness in CPU scheduling
- Minimum: 3-5 sentences

### Question 3: Thread Lifecycle
- A thread typically goes through these states: **New, Runnable, Running, Waiting, Terminated**
- **Walk through these states** for one process (e.g., P1) from your simulation
- For each state, **explain WHEN P1 enters that state** during execution and **which line/method call** in the code triggers that transition
- **Use specific method calls** from the code (`Thread.start()`, `Thread.join()`, `Thread.sleep()`) in your explanation
- Minimum: 3-5 sentences

### Question 4: Real-World Applications
- **Describe TWO real-world scenarios** where Round-Robin scheduling with threads would be useful
- **At least one scenario must be an operating-system-level example** (e.g., how an OS scheduler shares CPU time among running programs); the second can be any application you choose
- For each scenario: **What is the application/system?**
- For each scenario: **Why is Round-Robin scheduling appropriate?** (consider fairness, responsiveness, predictability)
- **Explain how the concepts** from this assignment apply to each scenario
- Minimum: 3-5 sentences

## ⚠️ Academic Integrity

### Critical Warnings:

1. **AI-Generated Code**: 
   - Pure AI-generated submissions without understanding will receive **zero marks**
   - You may be asked to explain your code in person
   - You must be able to answer questions about your implementation

2. **Plagiarism**: 
   - Copying from classmates results in **zero marks for all parties**
   - Each student has unique output based on their student ID

   - **Forking another student's repository** (instead of the starter repository) is plagiarism: it results in **zero marks for BOTH students** and the case is **referred to the College Student Issues Committee**

3. **Commit History**: 
   - Single bulk commits show poor practice and will be penalized
   - Commits must be spread over different dates/times

4. **Video Authenticity**: 
   - You must be able to answer questions about your work
   - Video should show genuine understanding, not memorized explanations
